# BARTist

BARTist is a [BART](https://www.bart.gov) train schedule app for Android.

## How does it work

It uses the official [BART API](https://www.bart.gov/schedules/developers/api) to fetch the list of stations and train departure times.
It also provides zoomable BART map for easy reference inside the app.

## Why is it cool

It is written entirely in [Qt](https://www.qt.io/), specifically QtQuick/QML using QtCreator.

This makes development extremely easy, without single line of Java code.
